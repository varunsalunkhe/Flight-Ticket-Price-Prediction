# Objective üéØ

In this project, we are going to build a Python Flight Fare Prediction web, that returns the fare prediction for a given set of travel details, like: departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, stoppages, and the airline carrier.
# Problem Statement ‚ùì

For purchasing an airplane ticket, the traditional purchase approach is to buy a ticket far
in advance of the flight‚Äôs departure date to avoid the risk that the price may increase
quickly before the date of departure. However, this is not always the case; if airline
corporations wish to increase sales, they can lower prices. Airlines employ a variety of
factors to decide flight ticket rates, including whether the trip is around the holidays, the
quantity of available seats on the plane, and even the month. Some of the variables can
be seen, while others are hidden. In this context, customers are attempting to discover
the best day to purchase a ticket, while airline firms, on the other hand, are attempting to
maximize overall revenue.
The main objective here is -
1. Airline companies have the freedom to change the flight ticket prices at any moment.
Travelers can save money if they choose to buy a ticket when its price is the lowest.
2. The problem is how to determine when is the best time to buy flight ticket for the
desired destination and period.
3. Airline companies use many different variables to determine the flight ticket prices:
indicator whether the travel is during the holidays, the number of free seats in the plane
etc. Some of the variables are observed, but some of them are hidden
4. In other word, when given the historical price and the current price of a flight for a
specific departure date, algorithms need to determine whether it is suitable to buy.

## App Functionality
![](templates/App_Functionality.gif)

- This repository represents **" Flight Ticket Price Predicton "**.
- With the help of this project we can predict the fare price of flight ticket.
  
## üìù Description
- In this project we have used **RandomForestRegressor** for predicting the ticket price.
