# Problem Statement ‚ùì

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the
Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either
definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last
category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that
there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it
be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

- This repository represents **" Mushroom Classification "**.
- With the help of this project we can detect whether mushroom with provided specifications is **Poisonous** or not.
  
## üìù Description
- This implemantation is based on official **Alphapose** repository https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose 
- In this project we have used **RandomForestClassifier** for classification of mushrooms.
