# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction

## iNeuron.ai-Internship

# Objective üéØ

In this project, we are going to build a Python Flight Fare Prediction App, that returns the fare prediction for a given set of travel details, like: departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, stoppages, and the airline carrier.
# Problem Statement ‚ùì

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the
Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either
definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last
category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that
there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it
be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

- This repository represents **" Flight Ticket Price Predicton "**.
- With the help of this project we can predict the fare price of flight ticket.
  
## üìù Description
- In this project we have used **RandomForestRegressor** for predicting the ticket price.
